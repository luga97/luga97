<h1 align="center">👋 Hi there! I'm Luis David.</h1>
<h3 align="center">A FullStack software Developer 🧑‍💻</h3>

I'm a Fullstack Developer with 6 years of experience building business-focused web and mobile applications. I specialize in **React**, **React Native**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **.NET**, **Golang**, and have strong proficiency with **PostgreSQL** and **Docker**. I’ve deployed solutions using **AWS** and am currently working with **.NET Core**, **React Native**, **Golang**, and **RabbitMQ**.

Beyond coding, I lead teams, gather requirements from stakeholders, and focus on delivering products that solve real business problems. I’m passionate about creating reliable, scalable solutions that drive impact.

In my side projects, I’ve explored various technologies like **Angular**, **Golang**, and **NestJS**, working on both web and mobile apps. I’m also continually expanding my knowledge by studying **microservices architecture**, **RxJS**, and **Svelte**, staying up-to-date with the latest tools and patterns in software development.

When I’m not deep in the tech world, I enjoy spending time outdoors with my family 🌳 or playing video games 🎮.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk tech or collaborate on a cool project!
